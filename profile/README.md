Community-maintained stylistic/formatting rules for ESLint, as [ESLint team is planning to deprecate them in core](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522) due to maintenance burden.

The organization was [initiated](https://twitter.com/antfu7/status/1701273844433252623) by [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu), who has been [proactively advocating using ESLint for formatting](https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier).

ðŸ‘‰ **Current Stage**: [**Migration Infra**](https://github.com/eslint-stylistic/eslint-stylistic#project-stages) - We are focusing on migrating stylistic rules from ESLint and `typescript-eslint` to this repo, and waiting for ESLint to announce and officially deprecate those rules.

If you have contributed to those stylistic rules in the ESLint or `typescript-eslint` repos and are interested in helping this project, [create an issue in this repo](https://github.com/eslint-stylistic/.github/issues) to volunteer yourself. Let's work together!
