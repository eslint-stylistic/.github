## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a placeholder organization for hosting stylistic rules for ESLint in the future, as [ESLint team is planning to deprecate them in core](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/17522).

The organization is initiated by [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu), who has been [proactively advocating using ESLint for formatting](https://antfu.me/posts/why-not-prettier). [[initiative tweet]](https://twitter.com/antfu7/status/1701273844433252623)

The work hasn't started yet, as we are waiting for more inputs from the ESLint and `typescript-eslint` teams. We will start once they have made the final decisions. And hopefully, make the migration smooth when ESLint v9 comes out.

If you have contributed to those rules in the ESLint or `typescript-eslint` repos and are interested in helping this project, [create an issue in this repo](https://github.com/eslint-stylistic/.github/issues) to volunteer yourself. Let's work together!
