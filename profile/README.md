<p align="center">Community-maintained stylistic/formatting ESLint rules for JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>

---

ðŸ‘‰ **Current Progress**: [**Stage 2: Waiting for ESLint's announcement**](https://eslint.style/contribute/project-progress) - We have finished the scripts of rules migration from both ESLint and `typescript-eslint` and they are usable. We are currently waiting for the ESLint team to announce the final list of rules.

If you have contributed to those stylistic rules in the ESLint or `typescript-eslint` repos and are interested in helping this project, [create an issue in this repo](https://github.com/eslint-stylistic/.github/issues) to volunteer yourself. Let's work together!
